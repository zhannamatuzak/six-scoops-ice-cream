# Six Scoops
Six Scoops is a terminal-based alternative to a hangman game for kids. This game combines learning with fun. The player tries to guess a word letter by letter before running out of six scoops of ice cream. It is told the player that it is very hot and it is a good idea to get an ice cream. Playing this game is an effective way to encourage kids' interest in learning English. While playing this game, kids will learn easy vocabulary (100 words) about summer. The words contain 3 to 5 letters and are appropriate for young learners.

## Planning

The following flowchart is created with [lucidchart](www.lucidchart.com). It visualizes the planning process for this application. Also, it was adited in PDF editor.

## Design

As this is simple terminal based application, the design process for the user interface was limited.

Different colour choices  are used in order to highlight and categorise messages to the user.

For example, error messages are displayed in red or with the warning emoji, while guessed letters are displayed in bright yellow.

The word itself is displayed blue for every correct guess. 

If the word is not guessed, the user can see the secret word with the blue arrow emoji on the left.

Emojis are used in the introduction throughout the game because the game is for kids.

Ice cream graphic illustration was made by me.

As the kids do not like reading, I colored the important words in the questions or descriptions and put emojis near them.

## Features



### Possible Future Features

 - The ```word_completion``` string looks like one line. And when the guessed letters joined it, letters sticked to each other. 
 To improve the text readability for kids, spaces between each underscore character can be added.

## Testing

The program was tested constantly during its development process.

### Validator Testing

 - HTML, CSS and JavaScript validation does not apply to this project. The template provided by Code Institute as provided to all students is assumed to be tested for the above. No further change or manipulation of the template's default HTML, CSS and JavaScript files has been performed.

 - PEP8 CI Python Validator

 - run.py
    - Error: On line 13 the code line contains whitespace
    - Solution: The whitespace is used for the design purpose and is not deleted intentionally.

 ![file run.py testing](assets/images/run-validate.png)

 - intro.py
    - Error 1: From line 9 to 14 found invalid escape sequences and whitespaces.
    - Solution: It can not be fix because it is a graphic ilustration.
    - Error 2: On lines 23, 25, 37, 45, and 53 are whitespaces.
    - Solution: I do not find them if I click to detect it. I suppose it is due to emojis usage.

 ![file intro.py testing](assets/images/intro-validate.png) 

 - six_scoops.py
   - Error: Whitespaces and escape sequences are found. 
   - Solution: It caccot be solved because the file contains graphic illustrations.

## Bugs

+ **Solved bugs**

1. The ```scoops``` variable was not mention as global in function.

  - *Solutions:* declare variable as global inside the function.

```
def scoops_number():
    """ Decrements scoops for each wrong guess """
    global scoops
    scoops -= 1
    print(
        f"‚ùå Wrong letter! "
        f"You have {Style.BRIGHT}{Fore.YELLOW}{scoops}{Style.RESET_ALL}"
        f" scoops of üç¶ left."
        )
```

## Deployment

This project was deployed with [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) using Code Institute's mock terminal
as provided with the Python Essentials template.

 - This project requires you to have Python installed on your local PC.

 - Create a local copy of the GitHub repository by following one of the two processes below:

    - Go to the [GitHub Repo page](https://github.com/zhannamatuzak/six-scoops-ice-cream).

    - Click the Code button and download the ZIP file containing the project.
    - Extract the ZIP file to a location on your PC.
 
 - Clone the repository:

    - Open a folder on your computer with the terminal.
    - Run the following command as on the screenshot below:

    `git clone https://github.com/zhannamatuzak/six-scoops-ice-cream.git`

 - Install Python module dependencies:

    - Activate a virtual environment
    'python3 -m venv .venv' then '.venv .venv/bin/activate'

    - Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt:
    'pip install -r requirements.txt

 - Create a [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) account (if not already existing) to host the project.

 - Create a new app with Heroku by clicking on "Creat a new app":

 ![New app](assets/images/create-app.png)

 - Provide your app name and region:

    - Write your project name. 
    The repository name on GitHub and the Heroku app name do not need to be the same. 
    - Choose your region. 
    If you still have not created  your own GitHub repository to host the code, do it now.

 ![Name, region](assets/images/app-name.png)

 - Add Config Var

    - You must add a Config Var provided by Code Institute for their student in Heroku's Settings.
    - If you do not add this, then your deployment may fail.
    - Also, you can store here your sensitive date, if you have.

 ![Config var](assets/images/app-name.png)

- In Settings:
  
    - add two two buildpacks: Python and NodeJS.
    - Click "Add Buildpack" and choose. Then click "Save Changes".
    - Please note, that the order of buildpacks is important!

    - Then click "Connect" to link your Heroku account to your repository code.
    - Scroll down the page. There are two opeions in this section:
       - set up autonatic deploys;
       - set up manual deploys.
