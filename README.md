# Six Scoops
Six Scoops is a terminal-based alternative to a hangman game for kids. This game combines learning with fun. The player tries to guess a word letter by letter before running out of six scoops of ice cream. It is told the player that it is very hot and it is a good idea to get an ice cream. Playing this game is an effective way to encourage kids' interest in learning English. While playing this game, kids will learn easy vocabulary (100 words) about summer. The words contain 3 to 5 letters and are appropriate for young learners.

## Planning

The following flowchart is created with [lucidchart](www.lucidchart.com). It visualizes the planning process for this application. Also, it was adited in PDF editor.

## Design

As this is simple terminal based application, the design process for the user interface was limited.

Different colour choices  are used in order to highlight and categorise messages to the user.

For example, error messages are displayed in red or with the warning emoji, while guessed letters are displayed in bright yellow.

The word itself is displayed blue for every correct guess. 

If the word is not guessed, the user can see the secret word with the blue arrow emoji on the left.

Emojis are used in the introduction throughout the game because the game is for kids.

Ice cream graphic illustration was made by me.

As the kids do not like reading, I colored the important words in the questions or descriptions and put emojis near them.

## Features

### Existing Features

#Logo#

 - Displays game title using ASCII

 ![Logo image](assets/images/logo.png)

#Introduction#
 ![Inro image](assets/images/introduction.png)
 

### Possible Future Features

 - The ```word_completion``` string looks like one line. And when the guessed letters joined it, letters sticked to each other. 
 To improve the text readability for kids, spaces between each underscore character can be added. 

 - Show the user not only which letters he has already guessed but also add a possibility to guess the whole word at once and show list of guessed words.

## Technologies Used

### Languages:

- [Python 3.11.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/): used to anchor the project and direct all application behavior

- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/): used to provide the start script needed to run the Code Institute mock terminal in the browser

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) used to construct the elements involved in building the mock terminal in the browser
---
### Frameworks/Libraries, Programmes and Tools:
#### Python modules/packages:

##### Standard library imports:

- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) was used to implement pseudo-random number generation.
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html ) was used to clear the terminal before running the program and bevor showing the rules.
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) was used to delay print statements.
- [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html) was used for string (ascii, emojis) manipulation
- [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) was used to create a typewriter-effect animation for strings.
 
##### Third-party imports:

- [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) was used to add colors and styles to the project.

#### Other tools:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used as the main tool to write and edit code.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to host the code of the website.
- [Canva Pro](https://www.canva.com/) and [bigimage](https://bigimage.11zon.com/en/image-crop/crop-image-without-losing-quality.php )were used to make and resize images for the README file.
- [Draw.io](https://www.lucidchart.com/) was used to make a flowchart for the README file.

## Testing

The program was tested constantly during its development process.

### Validator Testing

 - HTML, CSS and JavaScript validation does not apply to this project. The template provided by Code Institute as provided to all students is assumed to be tested for the above. No further change or manipulation of the template's default HTML, CSS and JavaScript files has been performed.

 - PEP8 CI Python Validator

 - run.py
    - Error: On line 13 the code line contains whitespace
    - Solution: The whitespace is used for the design purpose and is not deleted intentionally.

 ![file run.py testing](assets/images/run-validate.png)

 - intro.py
    - Error 1: From line 9 to 14 found invalid escape sequences and whitespaces.
    - Solution: It can not be fix because it is a graphic ilustration.
    - Error 2: On lines 23, 25, 37, 45, and 53 are whitespaces.
    - Solution: I do not find them if I click to detect it. I suppose it is due to emojis usage.

 ![file intro.py testing](assets/images/intro-validate.png) 

 - six_scoops.py
   - Error: Whitespaces and escape sequences are found. 
   - Solution: It caccot be solved because the file contains graphic illustrations.

## Bugs

+ **Solved bugs**

 1. The ```scoops``` variable was not mention as global in function.

  *Solutions:* declare variable as global inside the function.

```
def scoops_number():
    """ Decrements scoops for each wrong guess """
    global scoops
    scoops -= 1
    print(
        f"‚ùå Wrong letter! "
        f"You have {Style.BRIGHT}{Fore.YELLOW}{scoops}{Style.RESET_ALL}"
        f" scoops of üç¶ left."
        )
```
